To-Do

Aging Barrel Stack size (if I can find it!)
Faster Aging
Transfer to existing stacks (can I add a UI element?)
Forced sleep hour - no pass out at all?
Candles never run out
Auto-fireplace on/off
Change weather
harvest with scythe (CropSetter cutDetection/cutDetectionActiveAge ?)
No Mess
More items in shops
Trigger halloween/christmas

Free Building (TavernConstructionManager?)
	TavernConstructionModifications->apply changes -> MoneyMaterials eepfpdahifg = ConstructionUI.current.playerInfo.EEPFPDAHIFG.HLBNMAGMCON();
[All vege types] -> -9 any type of vegetable
	Somewhere they has to be a way to tell what items match a "wildcard" item!
	CraftingInventory?
Endless Buckets
	CommonReferences.bucketItem anf CommonReferences.bucketOfWaterItem
	Can I call CommonReferences.get_instance instead of CommonReferences.LLFCHIEGKBE ? Probably not.
	So make my own with an accessor
Free Crafting:
	Crafter.ChargeRecipeCost ? That's also where Buckets of water get
