To-Do

Aging Barrel Stack size (if I can find it!)
Faster Aging
Transfer to existing stacks (can I add a UI element?)
Forced sleep hour - no pass out at all?
Candles never run out
Auto-fireplace on/off
Change weather
better haggling
Cat opinion fix
Digging options? HoleInGround class IN PROGRESS
harvest with scythe (CropSetter cutDetection/cutDetectionActiveAge ?)
walk through crops (CropSetter cropCollider/collisionDetection/collisionDetectionActiveAge ?)
Wilson coins - everything costs 1 coin
No Mess
More items in shops
Trigger halloween/christmas
Free Building (TavernConstructionManager?)
	TavernConstructionModifications->apply changes -> MoneyMaterials eepfpdahifg = ConstructionUI.current.playerInfo.EEPFPDAHIFG.HLBNMAGMCON();
[All vege types] -> -9 any type of vegetable
	Somewhere they has to be a way to tell what items match a "wildcard" item!
	CraftingInventory?
Endless Buckets
	CommonReferences.bucketItem anf CommonReferences.bucketOfWaterItem
	Can I call CommonReferences.get_instance instead of CommonReferences.LLFCHIEGKBE ? Probably not.
	So make my own with an accessor
Free Crafting:
	Crafter.ChargeRecipeCost ? That's also where Buckets of water get 

	
public static CommonReferences LLFCHIEGKBE
{
	get
	{
		if (CommonReferences.HBIMADMGONO == null)
		{
			CommonReferences.HBIMADMGONO = UnityEngine.Object.FindObjectOfType<CommonReferences>();
		}
		return CommonReferences.HBIMADMGONO;
	}
}	
	
IngredientType[] IngredientGroup.ingredientsTypes and List<ItemMod> IngredientGrouppossibleItems are the things that go into an ingrediant vategory

IDEA: these extend item, so they are in the item database - probably all the items with negative numbers since that matches the item list & Unity Explorer!
Check exact type: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3561202/check-if-instance-is-of-a-type
Exact type: if (c.GetType() == typeof(TForm))
Type or subtype: if (c is TForm)
