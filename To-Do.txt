To-Do

Faster Aging
Transfer to existing stacks (can I add a UI element?) 
Forced sleep hour - no pass out at all?
Auto-fireplace on/off
Change weather
harvest with scythe (CropSetter cutDetection/cutDetectionActiveAge ?)
No Mess
More items in shops
Trigger halloween/christmas

Free Building (TavernConstructionManager?)
	TavernConstructionModifications->apply changes -> MoneyMaterials eepfpdahifg = ConstructionUI.current.playerInfo.EEPFPDAHIFG.HLBNMAGMCON();
Endless Buckets
	CommonReferences.bucketItem anf CommonReferences.bucketOfWaterItem
	Can I call CommonReferences.get_instance instead of CommonReferences.LLFCHIEGKBE ? Probably not.
	So make my own with an accessor
Free Crafting:
	Crafter.ChargeRecipeCost ? That's also where Buckets of water get 
	TavernConstructonAction extends ConstructionAction
	ConstructionAction.costs
	ConstructionPlayerInfo.CanPay() - make always true?
	TavernConstructonUI.CloseUI -> this.playerInfo.RemoveMaterialsUsed();
Double XP: TavernReputation.ChangeReputation(TavernReputation __instance, object[] __args)


reverting items and gold on cancel: TavernConstructionModifications

RevertModifications() ->

	private void IFMOAPNOKPD()
	{
		MoneyMaterials moneyMaterials = ConstructionUI.current.playerInfo.FLBEKHMDDOH;
		if (Application.isEditor)
		{
			Debug.Log("MinusMoneyMaterials " + this.MJGOMLDFKHK.DLMEJGKMNNA().OOCLMDHCHFL().ToString() + " / " + moneyMaterials.DLMEJGKMNNA().OOCLMDHCHFL().ToString());
		}
		moneyMaterials.CGBGCAIBGGN(this.MJGOMLDFKHK);
	}
		
1. Multiplier for Animal Harvest (right now I think it's just the Cow/Sheep milk)
2. Drops for Crabs/Turkeys/Farm Animals
3. Multiplier for fishing (get multiple of the fish you just caught)
5. Animals don't require Food and/or Food in Animal Dishes/Barns/Coops doesn't decrease
6. Cows/Sheep provide Milk every day.
