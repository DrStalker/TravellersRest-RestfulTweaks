To-Do

Faster Aging
Transfer to existing stacks (can I add a UI element?)
Forced sleep hour - no pass out at all?
Candles never run out
Auto-fireplace on/off
Change weather
harvest with scythe (CropSetter cutDetection/cutDetectionActiveAge ?)
No Mess
More items in shops
Trigger halloween/christmas

Free Building (TavernConstructionManager?)
	TavernConstructionModifications->apply changes -> MoneyMaterials eepfpdahifg = ConstructionUI.current.playerInfo.EEPFPDAHIFG.HLBNMAGMCON();
Endless Buckets
	CommonReferences.bucketItem anf CommonReferences.bucketOfWaterItem
	Can I call CommonReferences.get_instance instead of CommonReferences.LLFCHIEGKBE ? Probably not.
	So make my own with an accessor
Free Crafting:
	Crafter.ChargeRecipeCost ? That's also where Buckets of water get 
Double XP: TavernReputation.ChangeReputation(TavernReputation __instance, object[] __args)
