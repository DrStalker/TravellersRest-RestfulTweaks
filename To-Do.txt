To-Do

Aging Barrel Stack size (if I can find it!)
Faster Aging
Transfer to existing stacks (can I add a UI element?)
Sort (by what metric? probably not worth doing without a better plan)
Increase fish prices
Forced sleep hour - no pass out at all?
Candles never run out
Auto-fireplace on/ff
Change weather
better haggling
Cat opinion fix
Digging options? HoleInGround class IN PROGRESS
harvest sith scythe (CropSetter cutDetection/cutDetectionActiveAge ?)
walk through crops (CropSetter cropCollider/collisionDetection/collisionDetectionActiveAge ?)
Wilson coins - everything costs 1 coin
No Mess
Trigger halloween/christmas
Tavern/craftin/etc tile allowance
	ReputationDBAccessor.reputationDatabaseSO.reputations[]
	ReputationInfo.[lots of fields]
	Note: SetUpDatabase() puts that info in a Dictionary?
Free Building (TavernConstructionManager?)
	TavernConstructionModifications->apply changes -> MoneyMaterials eepfpdahifg = ConstructionUI.current.playerInfo.EEPFPDAHIFG.HLBNMAGMCON();
PArrot
		More Cookies: BirdNPC.canGiveCookieTime == min time between cookeis
		BirdNPC.cookiesGivenPerDay = check for >=2, so reset to 0 on... BirdNPC.MouseUp?
		BirdInstance.commentsQuality == trianing level?
Juice -> Any Juice: look for ingredient 1325 and remove the modifer 
[All vege types] -> -9 any type of vegetable
	Somewhere they has to be a way to tell what items match a "wildcard" item!
	CraftingInventory?
Endless Buckets
	CommonReferences.bucketItem anf CommonReferences.bucketOfWaterItem
	Can I call CommonReferences.get_instance instead of CommonReferences.LLFCHIEGKBE ? Probably not.
	So make my own with an accessor
Free Crafting:
	Crafter.ChargeRecipeCost ? That's also where Buckets of water get 

	
public static CommonReferences LLFCHIEGKBE
{
	get
	{
		if (CommonReferences.HBIMADMGONO == null)
		{
			CommonReferences.HBIMADMGONO = UnityEngine.Object.FindObjectOfType<CommonReferences>();
		}
		return CommonReferences.HBIMADMGONO;
	}
}
